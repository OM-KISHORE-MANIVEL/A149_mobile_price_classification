1. Research question

Is there a correlation between the weight of a mobile device and its battery capacity?

2. Overview

This project investigates whether there is a correlation between the weight of a mobile device and its battery capacity using data from the "Mobile Price Classification - test.csv" dataset on Kaggle.

3. Files Included

test.csv: Dataset containing mobile device features, including weight (mobile_wt) and battery capacity (battery_power).

plot_data.r: R script to clean, analyze, and visualize the data. The script produces scatter plots and computes correlation metrics.

4. Objective

To determine if there is a statistical relationship between the weight of a mobile device (mobile_wt) and its battery capacity (battery_power).

5. Methodology

Load Dataset: Import test.csv for analysis.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing or erroneous values.

Visualization: Use scatter plots to observe trends between weight and battery capacity.

Correlation Analysis: Calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient to quantify the relationship.

Spearmanâ€™s correlation measures the linear relationship between two continuous variables. It ranges from -1 to 1:
1: Perfect positive correlation.
0: No linear relationship.
-1: Perfect negative correlation

Results Interpretation: Interpret findings and determine if the null hypothesis can be rejected.

6. Instructions

Prerequisites

R and RStudio installed on your system.

Required R libraries: ggplot2.

Steps

Prepare Dataset: Ensure test.csv is in the same directory as the script.

Run the Script: Execute plot_data.r in RStudio.

View Outputs:

9. Notes
Outliers or unusual data points, if found, may influence the correlation result.
Ensure the dataset has no missing values in the columns mobile_wt and battery_power.
